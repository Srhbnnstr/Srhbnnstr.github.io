THE CHALLENGE


Rent Application is an online software company that provides a responsive web rental application & automatic screening service. Rent Application is one of the only services on the market that offer only rental applications and tenant screening services. Eric, the CEO of Rent Application, laid out his business goals for us. Rent Application is focused on targeting landlords that do not need a bundle service. For this reason, they consider themselves not direct competitors to those companies which provide a “bundle like” service. They wish to stay within the realm they are in.
They currently have approximately 30,000 users registered, but have seen a sharp drop off of users after creating an account. At the time we were hired as designers, they were seeing 84.5% of users who hit the Rent Application landing page bounce entirely. This is an extremely high rate of potential business loss and showed us right away that a possible part of our scope would be revising the landing page as users were not compelled enough to go further than that upon visiting the site.

Although our client was seeing a sharp decline in new users, 24% of people who hit the signup page actually do sign up. Current users of Rent Application agree that the landing page made it hard to understand what the purpose of the service was, but once they got past that and gave it a shot, they told us that Rent Application was a very important piece in their day-to-day work lives. This was proof to us that there was definitely potential to bring more users in, we just needed to define how we would accomplish this.


In our initial kickoff, Eric requested we focus on the onboarding and dashboard in our scope, as where most users exist in the site. He was also open to any other areas that we suggested needed work on, so if time in our design sprint allowed, we planned to test and redesign the landing page because of the analytics on initial bounce rate we were given.


THE APPROACH
Analyzing The Competition
(INSERT COMPETITOR MATRIX)


We compared six services’ interfaces and features that Eric considered competitors to Rent Application. We found a major takeaway to be true:


Almost none of the sites we looked at had a modern, user-friendly experience, except for Cozy. The rental application landscape is crammed with clunky, out of date websites that are confusing and frustrating. We see this as a great opportunity for Rent Application to stand out amongst the current market.


After conducting the competitive analysis, we began to assess Rent Application. Why is there such a massive drop-off? Here’s what we initially hypothesized before conducting further research:


We assumed that the dashboard is confusing, price options are unclear and the onboarding process is too lengthy.


We sought to validate these hypotheses by moving forward and conducting our first round of user interviews and testing using Rent Application’s current website.


OUR PROCESS
We interviewed 10 current and prospective users of Rent Application who worked as landlords and property managers. We asked users many open-ended, behavioral based questions in our interviews, but had a few major internal research questions in mind going into our interviews:




Why are users dropping off after signing up?
The site was seeing a major decline in new users, but has a clientele of existing users. Once users get past the initial confusion of the landing page, it’s more likely they’ll stick around. We wanted to figure out how we would help more users get past this point.
What are the pain points of current and prospective users?
Not only were there obvious pain points in the dashboard, but Eric sent along a list of customer feedback that indicated there was user dissatisfaction throughout the entire site.
Why would a target user, not currently using the product, not want to transition to RentApplication?
Especially because so many target users are still using a paper application process. How could we make users excited about transitioning to a digital process in order to make their day-to-day work life easier?




We also asked participants to run through a couple of task flows that a user would likely complete to get an idea of the overall goals and needs of the target user using Rent Application. These were based around seeing how users would create an application and expect to screen a prospective tenant.


We finished our testing with a set of qualitative questions to gain insight on where users frustrations lie. There was a mixture of negative opinions and positive experiences, the latter mainly coming from existing users who had gotten past the initial confusion of the landing page.


What users said:


“Site needs to act more like an app when used on a phone, since so many people use their phones for everything”


“I like that Rent Application is less work for the landlord and less involved than cozy”


“Way too much text on most pages, I don’t want to read all of this”


“Rent Application does what I need it to do for processing applicants easily and quickly - Plus it’s cheaper than other services I’ve used in the past”


“The first time I visited the site, I was confused about what they offered and if it was targeted towards landlords”


We took this feedback and pulled noteworthy comments and feedback to compile an affinity diagram that helped us group our data into important portions.


(INSERT AFFINITY DIAGRAM ACTION SHOT)


Positives:
Cheaper than other competitors
Users love the option of a free applicaiton
The process is very easy once you figure out how to use the website
Quick response with customer support email service


Frustrations:
Poor mobile experience (This was a complaint amongst all existing participants)
Tenant application is very long on one page and not broken down into understandable sections
Save button on forms is not prevalent enough, this could also be solved with an auto save feature
Getting logged out and sent back to the home page any time the back button is clicked, even if it wasn’t the previous page
Confusion about price points


Synthesizing our user data


We had a lot of insightful quotes and feedback from our users to work from, but we really wanted  to empathize with our target audience on a deeper level. In order to better understand what a user is feeling throughout the process of using Rent Application, we created a customer journey map and a persona named Maria as an aggregation of our gathered user data.

(INSERT CJM BREAKDOWN)


Our client claimed to not have many touch points with their users, so we presented our client with Maria as our synthesized user experience using Rent Application to help them gain perspective they may have never considered previously.


Maria’s journey was a mobile experience to highlight this aspect of users’ frustrations, so we intended to focus on the desktop experience primarily with the intention of creating adjusted mobile wireframes as well that would be presented as a deliverable for Eric to use and pass onto a UI designer in the future.


This process of analyzing and reflecting on the important takeaways led us to the following problem that we aimed to solve:


Users desire the features that Rent Application provides. However once new users create an account, users find that the product has imprecise directions, confusing organization, and faulty functionality. Repeated feelings of frustration cause new users to abandon Rent Application. How will we design interactions that support users along a clear and efficient pathway toward screening tenants in order to increase user retention?


Before moving onto our design sprint, we crafted a set of design principles to use as a guide while creating individual concepts:


Reducing the Learning Curve: Provide clear and concise directions in palatable bites that guide users from one step to the next

Credible: Convey a sense of trust with language that accurately reflects the product


Less is More: Promote simplicity by limiting user choice, shortening text, removing eyesores, and placing graceful calls to action into the design.




Our Process


Now that we were aligned on the area of opportunity to improve Rent Application, we moved into our second sprint and started creating concepts on features that were best to test in our individual designs.


(INSERT PHOTOS OF ROUND ROBIN)


We each voted for the ideas we found most crucial to include in our low-fidelity prototypes.

Here are the concepts we chose to test in each prototype:


Onboarding
Simplifying the steps for the initial onboarding, since the current onboarding on the site was very long and not executed well
Removing onboarding all together
(include low-fi examples of both)


Language
Professional language
conversational language
		(include low-fi examples of both)


Dashboard layout
Mental models, closer to what paper users are familiar with
Modern, minimalist design
		(include low-fi examples of both)


Creating an application
Completely customizable application, similar to what the existing site offers
ready-to-send, full application, with minimal ability for customization
		(include low-fi examples of both)




Concept Testing


We created low-fidelity desktop prototypes using Sketch and tested five individuals varying in roles including landlords, property managers, a broker and a leasing agent. Our second sprint only allowed three days for us to create a set of wireframes and test them so we unfortunately weren’t able to produce the intended mobile low-fidelity set we planned. We still wanted to create mobile wireframes for Rent Application because we knew that there was so much room for improvement on the mobile experience, so we chose to test those in our next sprint.
(INSERT VENN DIAGRAM OF OUR DEMOGRAPHIC)
(LAYOUT EACH OF 3 PROTOTYPES - PROFESSIONAL, MODERN, MENTAL MODEL - TAKEAWAYS UNDER EACH)


Takeaways from professional prototype:
Technical, professional language throughout
Users liked the familiarity of a paper style application layout
A more guided approach


Takeaways from mental model prototype:
Overall, the mental model dashboard was desired.
Sorting the dashboard by property was very appreciated
The dashboard needs to draw the eye to the most common actions


Takeaways from modern prototype:
Onboarding isn’t necessary
Simple but too simple?
Why did these features exist?


We tested users in a wide demographic, ages ranging from 22 to more established, older landlords. We were certain we needed to create something that would accommodate as many target users as possible, for the tech skill levels of those in the real estate industry were widely varied.


Moving toward a solution
Within our prototypes, we all implemented:
A reduced learning curve by providing users with guided options
Reduced ambiguity with less text and clearer language
Increased credibility by explaining how Rent Application works and how they are the best option for sending applications and screening potential tenants.


Our next step was to converge on one design for our final prototype. We all had really successful features so we chose to take these pieces of our individual prototypes and combine them to create our mid-fidelity prototype.


Best of the best


Jason’s landing page
(MID-FI EXAMPLE)
Clear, professional language that allowed for a quick understanding of what Rent Application provides


Jeff’s mental model dashboard
(MID-FI EXAMPLE)
Helped users understand the functionality of the separate application status folders


Sarah’s paper style application
(MID-FI EXAMPLE)
Creating a streamlined process that allows users to choose reports and create applications to send out as quickly as possible


We created an information architecture map as a visual that we could depend on so we were all on the same page moving forward. The site map ensured that we weren’t missing any important existing pieces of Rent Application, as well as validating that our newly added elements were correctly connected.

Usability Testing
For our final round of testing, we had users complete the task of creating an application and sending it to a prospective tenant on our desktop and mobile prototypes. We also asked them to think aloud as much as possible so we could understand what they liked and disliked.
What users loved:
LANDING PAGE
Layout of content
(MID-FI EXAMPLE - LANDING PAGE OR SIGN UP)
Newspaper model that demonstrated what was most important.
Testimonials
(MID FI EXAMPLE)
Included testimonials with real photos to increase trust and credibility


DASHBOARD


Folder organization structure


(MID FI EXAMPLE)


Collapsable sections and showing only what was needed was greatly appreciated


(QUOTE) “I really like the way this dashboard is laid out, it’s so simple”


Notifications


(MID FI EXAMPLE)


Added glanceable notification badges to allow users to know when they had new reports without having to locate by digging through the entire submitted applications section.
APPLICATIONS


Application management
(MID FI EXAMPLE)


“Properties with new reports” instead of “active applications” made the application section of the dashboard easier to understand for users


Creating applications
(MID FI EXAMPLE)


Added pagination and easily viewable sections while creating an application.


Reports


(MID FI EXAMPLE)


Included a bundled application package along with making pricing more understandable

RECOMMENDATIONS
Because Rent Application aims to provide a specialized service of only providing tenant applications and screenings, there needs to be an attempt to include every possible situation that a potential tenant could bring when applying for a property. These are the future recommendations we suggested to Eric in order to provide users with a more well-rounded, customizable experience:
Adding customizable addendums and special circumstance sections to applications, such as pets or additional accessibility needs.


Decreasing the current frequency of emails sent to users. My team all signed up for Rent Application accounts and were surprised that we got multiple emails a week that didn’t have any necessary or helpful content. This was not back by research that this was also a pain point for our target audience so this would be something we would test in the future if we had more time.


Making sure all of the screens and elements share the same styling. There were certain screens that we didn’t have time to focus on in our limited time frame. Some of these screens didn’t visually align with the site’s overall look, such as the error page which included a different type-face and color scheme.


WHAT I LEARNED
We needed to make sure we were going to deliver what we had presented to our client. When we presented our customer journey map and Maria’s experience using Rent Application with a mobile platform in mind, our client expected more of a focus on mobile testing; we didn’t clarify that desktop was our primary concern. We thought it would be important to showcase how poor the mobile experience was for users. What we presented should have aligned more with our scope and primary focus and a promise to include mobile as a secondary concern. We still delivered an accompanying set of mobile wireframes along with our desktop prototype so that they will be able to use these to improve their mobile interface in the future, but the majority of our testing was completed on our desktop prototypes. This was an important learning experience for me; I am now more prepared to communicate clearly and demonstrate what the client can expect in terms of final deliverables.
